### References That Influenced My Approach
This project was shaped by recurring patterns observed across decision theory, explainable systems, and practical product design rather than a single academic source.

#### 1. Decision Theory & Scoring Models
- **Weighted Sum Model (WSM):** A standard approach for multi-criteria decision-making. Influenced the core logic: weighted normalization → aggregation → ranking.
- **MCDA Concepts:** Reinforced the importance of explicit trade-offs and prioritizing explainability over black-box optimization.

#### 2. Explainable Systems & Trust
- **XAI Principles:** Users trust systems they can audit. Explanations must align perfectly with underlying logic.
- **Design Impact:** Motivated deterministic scoring and a strict separation between mathematical computation and narration.

#### 3. Practical Product Documentation
- **Transparency-First Docs:** Influenced the problem-to-solution framing and the explicit documentation of design trade-offs.
- **Architectural Clarity:** Prioritized transparency over marketing-style abstraction.

#### 4. Human Factors & UX Observations
- **Behavioral Insights:** Users struggle with abstract scoring (1–10) and prefer stating facts over doing math.
- **Result:** Shifted normalization and scale mapping from the user to the engine.

### AI Usage Policy
AI was utilized as an assistive layer, strictly adhering to a "Suggestive, Not Authoritative" role.

| Category | AI Role & Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accepted** | Used for **structuring and narration only**. The Structure Agent converts free-form user input into a draft set of options, criteria, and attribute descriptions. The Explanation Agent converts deterministic engine outputs into human-readable explanations without altering scores or rankings. |
| **Modified** | AI-generated drafts are treated as **suggestions, not truth**. Users must explicitly confirm or edit cost vs. benefit classification, ordinal scales, and extracted criteria. Any AI-proposed structure can be overridden before it enters the decision engine. |
| **Rejected** | AI is **never allowed** to assign weights, normalize values, compute scores, rank options, or influence final outcomes. All mathematical operations are handled exclusively by deterministic code to ensure repeatability, auditability, and trust. |

**Key Principle:** AI is used to reduce user friction, not to replace human judgment.

### AI Prompting Notes

During development, multiple iterative prompts were used to:
- Extract draft decision structures from natural language
- Test failure modes in cost vs benefit classification
- Validate explanation consistency
- debug and enhance the code


These prompts were exploratory and iterative by nature.  
They are not included inline to preserve clarity, can be found below:

- "Like i need to make this before March 2nd and i don't know how to tackle this question"
- "Okk so Are they reffering to a chat bot? with inputs and constraints given to it?"
- "I have a simple doubt for this LLM's should be used right?"
- "How the is it even possible?"
- "How to design an explainable decision-making system?"
- "Explain weighted scoring model with examples"

- "Give me some repo names"
- "Update the wording of that one AI box"
- "But i need you to make it a typed flowchart so that i can add it in Design_Diagram.md"
- "Anyways so what ive done today is made a repo designed a flow diagram and now what i need is how do i do this in a weighted approach?"
- "So essentally these are the challenges that i have right now: 1. Store variables... 2. Validation equation... 3. Make 3 agents..."
- "Okk so why are we using the def main()?"
- "yk what just give me an input to test it, a real world example of laptops in the price range 40,000-60,000"
- "Well im gonna need the ai queries and the search queries from today so that i can document it."
- "Nah what we're gonna do today is: 1. Add details in BUILD_PROCESS.md... 2. Add prompts... 3. Structure... 4. Static model... 5. API key"
- "We need to fix this Normalize cost criteria, i mean if user enters something and if its going inverted then its a problem.. should we add in AI here?"
- "i have no idea what you just said, ill tackle this tomorrow first thing in the morning as my head is spinning"
- "Some criteria are better when numbers are higher, some are better when numbers are lower."
- "I shalll upate this now get_list_from_user, Just rename all the things with the old ones so there's no comfusion"
- "Okk now give me some options to test this new change"
- "while the program is asking for this umm what should i even do?"
- "so how do i make this program understand which criteria should be which?"
- "We are going to do this: Rank criteria by importance..."
- "shoud i remove the Rate each option for each criterion (1–10):"
- "This function? i mean, i replaced the get_weights function with get_weights_from_ranking and this seems confusing as hell this rate each option"
- "This is the headache.. Ill tell you two major flaws in this... 1. Priority vs ratings... 2. Final list is wrong..."
- "We should go with model 2, WE need AI to help in this scenario"
- "Accept criteria (which may have different weights or importance)"
- "So ig using AI is useful, I cant use Langchain because for it to work API is essential but what if i use it directly on python? It would run without fully relying on AI right?"
- "decision-lens This is good"
- "<image> Well i have this as a design"
- "So essentally these are the challenges that i have right now."
- "1. I need to store the varibles for accepting multiple options.What would be the best data structure? The thing which is coming into my mind is list, as i can store the options as well as criteria and i can change it in the future as well.."
- "2.I need a vaidation equation."
- "3.I need to make 3 agents:"
- "a. The initial agent which helps the user with option and criteria. we'll call it structure agent"
- "b. Score agent which is used only if the user cannot provide ratings by themselves"
- "c. Explanation Generator which will provide the final explanation"
- "Modified the readme"
- "Nah what we're gonna do today is "
- "1. Add details in BUILD_PROCESS.md ill provide a rough sketch you'll have to polish it later."
- "2.Add the prompts as well as Google searches till today in RESEARCH_LOG.md"
- "3. I need a structure for this, i meant the architecture of what files are needed "
- "4. I need a working static model atleast so i can conclude if it works or not and then in the next iteration , it can be dynamic model "
- "5. Get an OPENAI API key "
- "“Some criteria are better when numbers are higher, some are better when numbers are lower.”"
- "Enter importance for each criterion (any positive number):"
- "Price:"
- "We are going to do this"
- "Rank criteria by importance (1 = highest):"
- "1. Price"
- "2. RAM"
- "3. Performance"
- "4. Battery"
- "right now as the UI is confusing as hell."
- "Option: Laptop A (₹42k, i3, 8GB RAM)"
- "This is the headache.. Ill tell you two major flaws in this. 1.I've already given the priority but its again asking for ratings.. No user understands how to enter rating from 1 to 10. So either get rid of that or make a workaround from the priority or we'll make ai do that for the user. That itself is confusing af. 2. The final list is absolutely wrong. it just put the priciest laptop on top"
- "How scoring works WITHOUT ratings
  You already have laptop specs embedded in option names:
  This decision system is not just for laptops its for every domain, laptop was just an example"
- "We should go with model 2, WE need AI to help in this scenario"
- "Well we're going the AI route now.. So Ive generated an API key from OPENAI suggest me what model i should go for and ive only added 10Dollars into it. so.."
- "Okk so this is the thing, What i intend to do with the AI, restructure the input from the user, If user asks for whats the best SUV i can get in the budget of 10 Lakhs with the most power, 5 seater , has a brand value. Well it should generate constraints right? and options.. Then it can ask user for priority and everything. But the Model should know what all are the cars in the market right?.. So ig the first agent would have to do a digging from the internet rigtht?"
- "Yeah youre absolutely right.. Ig it doesnt have to be that complex"
- "<pasted the valication engine> change it so that it normalises weights"
- "<pasted the decisom_engine> "
- "<pasted the get weights function> what about this function now?"
- "So we're removing get_ratings right?"
- "structure_agent → attributes We shall do this tomorrow But right now,its testing time"
- "uhh.. i dont understand what you mean nor do i know how to make this file for testing.
  tell you what This is how we're gonna test it..
  I wanna buy a laptop where the priority is Performance>Price>RAM>Battery>Material
  Suppose there are 4 laptops in this scenario "
- "<pasted the main function> I mean what changes should be done here as we've removed ratings? "
- "So..let me get this straight.. we need 3 agents right? An input agent to get inputs and structure it. Another agent for this rating generation and at last an explanation agent"
- "So.. explain to me how the code actually works because I'm not exactly sure of what's happening rn"
- "Where would I keep the api key? And how would I call it?"
- "We're going to use the .env so anyone can just add in their own api key "
- "Can I like import OPEN_API_KEY or something? For example I'll make a ".env" file and add OPEN_AI_KEY= <KEY> inside it"
- "how can I test if the Api key work.. i mean I did buy credits into the OPENAI account "
- "before that how much should i add as a limit?"
- "a virtual environment is a good idea right? so that dependencies are isolated?"
- "API key works,got this lets just ask it to tell a joke "
- "should the .vscode forlder be added into gitignore?"

## Accepted vs Rejected Ideas
Initial thoughts on system architecture:

### Idea 1
1. **Structure Agent**: Whose only job is to convert user's decision problem into structured data.
2. **Scoring Agent**: Whose job is to estimate relative scores for options against the criteria.
3. **Explanation Agent**: Whose job is to explain decision results clearly and simply.

### Idea 2
1. **Structure Agent (Input → Attributes)** ✅
   - _(AI-assisted, optional)_
   - **What it does:**
     - Takes messy human language
     - Extracts:
       - Options
       - Criteria
       - Cost vs Benefit
       - Raw attributes (numbers, categories, unknowns)

2. **Explanation Agent (Scores → Human Explanation)** 📝
   - _(Optional AI polish)_
   - **What it does:**
     - Turns math + rankings into readable explanations
     - Highlights dominant criteria and trade-offs
     - Mirrors user priorities

```python
# TEMPORARY TEST DATA (attributes, not ratings)
# Treat these as raw factual values
attributes = {
    "Laptop A": {
        "Performance": 9,
        "Price": 9,
        "RAM": 8,
        "Battery": 6,
        "Material": 8
    },
    "Laptop B": {
        "Performance": 7,
        "Price": 6,
        "RAM": 7,
        "Battery": 7,
        "Material": 7
    },
    "Laptop C": {
        "Performance": 5,
        "Price": 3,
        "RAM": 6,
        "Battery": 8,
        "Material": 6
    },
    "Laptop D": {
        "Performance": 6,
        "Price": 7,
        "RAM": 6,
        "Battery": 6,
        "Material": 9
    }
}
```

"this is the test data, and in the real world no human is gonna type like this. So does this come under structure agent?"

- "Give me the code for the structure agent"
- "how do i test this?"
- "well it did run and the structered data is spat out"

- Well mjor flaws, that is when i add a new option it should ask for attribute next and not at the end and when it asked for attribute and even when i inputted it the mapped attribute is still none for phone c
- My question is when a user adds a new option and adds a criteria for it, should t again go to the structure agent so it becomes more reliable?

- okk so no more sending it back to the ai, ive done all the changes now its time for the test phase again

- Okk i typed in the weight of each phones why is it still None?
- weight (enter number only, unit: grams):
- This will take away the confusion, so lets implement it
- So if i remove the prompt_missing_attributes what will happen exactly?

- This is how all 3 looks now , but in confirm_criteria its a warning saying that options[name][c] = float(val) "options" is not defined

- just modify it, my head is spinning atp
- Invalid value. Please enter a number only (e.g., 200). Invalid value. Please enter a number only (e.g., 200).
- I cant get my head around why this was printed twice
- Well there's one more thing well after when the structure agent maps the benefit and the cost, it asks the user to pick the number to invert it right? it looks confusing at first or its just typing done to get out of it.. which is kinda.. meh.. i mean its okay.. but the problem is once user types 1 or 2 to swap the benefit / cost there's isnt another print statement , so no visualisation if that has inverted or not

- Dude i can feel that this is like near completion and i'm hoping that the explanation_agent doesn't have much hassle
- I dont have a structure_decision like as such.. I can share the structre_agent.py. I'm using the OPEN AI API. I can add the "Strongly recommended hardening (next step)" im using gpt 4o mini rn. I mean as long as im only using text prompts right? so I have like 10$ remaining in the budget and i havent like used 10 cents ig.

A list of options
A list of evaluation criteria

For EACH criterion you MUST:
Classify it as either:
• "benefit" (higher values are better), or
• "cost" (lower values are better)

If the criterion is QUALITATIVE:
• You MUST provide an explicit ordinal scale
• The scale MUST be ordered from lowest → highest
• Example: ["cheap", "affordable", "expensive"]

If the criterion is NUMERIC:
• You MUST specify a unit (e.g. "USD", "grams", "hours")
• You MUST NOT provide a scale
Extract raw numeric values when the user provides numbers
Use descriptive terms ONLY if numeric values are not available
Use "unknown" when information is missing

IMPORTANT:
All cost/benefit classifications are PROVISIONAL
The user will confirm or edit them
Prefer being explicit over being brief

- nah nah We are doing extreme testing. Suppose i want to travel from Pathanamthitta to Munnar on a bike.Suppose there are 4 routes, just search the web for that pls. for this ik how the condition of all . Assign the route 2 and 4, has less pot holes . Route 1 have the best scenic roads. Route 3 is the longest, but is longest and also have excellent scenes.Distance is my least priority. Scenary and roads are my top priority.. so... like structure an input like that so that i can test EVERYTHING, also dont name routes like 1,2,3,4 make some names.
- nah we're gonna stress test it, but this time we're gonna add in numbers as well into the mix, also what all be should be added into the mix so it proves to be a stress tester?

- Update this as ive alread modified the input_helpers.py with resolve_scale_mismatch
- in the new confirm_ordinal_scales there's no normalized={}
- or the normalized_key = meta so it isnt needed right?

- we'll do fix 1 of adding a warning and also fix 2 of offer "map all" where if the user selects m Auto map similar values then it will suggest and will show the suggested mapping page and can prompt if they accept it or not, so in the end user is fully under control and nothing breaks
- well, this is a good point to anothr support. when the rankings are listed. The program ends. But for a user, his decison can be changed after he saw the rankings, so we are not allowing him to change the options and criteria. the program just stops. what if he have to modify it again?

- So , inn here fix the flow as well as call it after every succesful action as well..
- Ive already defined the print_scale funcition in input_helpers
- okk so how do i do the Optional enhancement 
```python
for c in normalized_criteria:
mapped[option].setdefault(c, None)
```
- I mean if its not necessary, then..
- there is one thing the debubg print statemts only work in the first  run and after run if i change the options , it wont work
- there is one thing the debubg print statemts in main.py only work in the first  run and after run if i change the options , it wont work so that i cant see the mapped attributes and everthing for debugging
- We'll go with fix 2, 
- okk so now i want you to give me a specific domain example for example i am in a restaurat and i want to eat a dish . give 4 specific dish names let there be numeric values as well as ordinal values. for price sy one as 1,200 rupees other as 500 RS . Also include calories and protein. My aim is to eat an afoordable protein rich food which is tasty as well
- <pasted the debug op> I mean i cant change the ranking, like if i prioritize one over the other after seeing the results i cant change the ranking now
- plus on the previous run the wording was affordability and it was quite confusing. maybe its a structure agent problem

```text
STRUCTURE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

You are an assistive decision-structuring agent.

Your role is to HELP the user structure a decision problem.

You DO NOT make decisions.

You must PRODUCE A DRAFT STRUCTURE that the USER will review and confirm.

Your responsibilities are to SUGGEST:

The decision goal

A list of options

A list of evaluation criteria


For EACH criterion you MUST:

Classify it as either:

• "benefit" (higher values are better), or

• "cost" (lower values are better)

If the criterion is QUALITATIVE:

• You MUST provide an explicit ordinal scale

• The scale MUST be ordered from lowest → highest

• Example: ["cheap", "affordable", "expensive"]

If the criterion is NUMERIC:

• You MUST specify a unit (e.g. "USD", "grams", "hours")

• You MUST NOT provide a scale

Extract raw numeric values when the user provides numbers

Use descriptive terms ONLY if numeric values are not available

Use "unknown" when information is missing


IMPORTANT NAMING RULE:

Criterion names must refer to the RAW MEASURABLE ATTRIBUTE

Do NOT use derived or interpretive names such as:

"affordability", "value", "quality", "overall goodness"

Use concrete attributes instead:

"price", "cost", "calories", "protein", "time", "distance"

The interpretation (e.g., affordability) will be handled later via cost/benefit and weighting


IMPORTANT:

All cost/benefit classifications are PROVISIONAL

The user will confirm or edit them

Prefer being explicit over being brief


You MUST NOT:

Assign weights

Score options

Rank options

Convert descriptors into numbers

Recommend any option


Output ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.

Do not include explanations outside the JSON.

"""
```
- Ig this is okay?
- okk give me another stress testing prompt so that i can test every single thing thorughly
- well one thing i noticed is that while ranking, like there was no reprentation of the criterias , without seeing all the criterias, user cant effectively provide a ranking. Also, I ranked driving feel and price with the same number.. uh.. should that be the case?

- Show a criteria summary before ranking
Enforce unique ranks (no ties)

- If no numeric values are provided for a measurable attribute, prefer a qualitative ordinal scale.
I had added this rule to the prompt and yet

- ig we'll integrate because i think if this is not done, it might mess up the logics and the flow
``` text
if no scale AND no numeric data:

ask user to define a scale  
 or he can skip it

confirm scale (existing or newly created)

detect mismatches

resolve mismatches
```
- there should be choices, some are lazy and they just want something

```text
Add three choices at scale-missing moments
✔ Default suggestion = Define scale
✔ Provide Auto-generate for lazy users
✔ Make Ignore explicit, never silent
```
- Yess this is right and the auto generated scale can be editable later as well
Give me that

- --pasted the code-- this is the current confirm_ordinal_scales so i dont want you to mess up what is working right now only add new features
also each comment should be untouched and if adding new blocks it should be commented as well
- let me test it
- --pasted debug--
- I think everything is working as expected and the system has matured
- okk give me a commit msg for today for all the problems identified fixes and in the next commit we're gonna implement the explanation agent
- We're in the final stages..  Explanation Agent is the easy part
- Ig well go with the AI assisted Explanation Agent? that would be the logical choice right?

```text
Design the exact Explanation Agent prompt

Implement the deterministic explanation payload builder what exactly is this deterministic explanation payload builder?

Well, i need it such a way that, at the end it produces an explanation and suppose when the user edits the option or criteria and when the engine provides a ranking it should produce an output then as well.. Bascially it should explain along with the changing rankings

- can i ask something?when i typed in to manually set the scale it only asked me to map the fun part? was all the other scales automatically matched?

- okk theres one another ux thingy if i type in 1 to change the criteria importance at last it prompts to rank but here it doesnt show me what all to rank like im completely blind, in the first flow of program its there but not here

- okk give me another test prompt but this time it should actually trigger some of the following criteria didnt have scale, i mean that option

-Theres like a quadrillion things just change it and give me the whole thing and also tell me where i should chnge next with the exact file name,i dont wanna guess
- from utils.scale_resolution import resolve_scale_mismatch there's no such thing
- Just give me the fixed code ill just paste
- so basically what did we do? map the ones made by user as user and the automatic ai as ai and it only asks for the humann changed one?

because the current explanation looks very generic and less simple. dont get me wrong. its detailed but for a normal user it sounds technically

- this is excelent.. holy mother.. I'm done with 90% of the hard part now. Give me a commit msg.
i remember fighting with it in the morning when salary data wasnt available.
implemented the explanation builder and even added explanation agent and lastly did some cleanup
also when does that msg actually pop up? it only comes in certain scenarios the value missing suggestion

- theres this one problem. when i edit the scales and rename it. The current largest scale would ask me where it has to be mapped, if i say ignore and dont map, then all the other renamed scales are not mapped. and when i look at debug , scale is there but it becomes none in mapped

- One critical note (short):
You never persist _previous_scale into criteria before attribute_mapper runs.
So the auto-compress logic I pointed out will only half-work unless:

When a scale is edited (rename/shrink), you do:

Wdym, does this work or not?


-Ill paste the confirm_ordinal_scaes and resolve_scale_mismatch fix it fully for me so that i can copy paste i dont want to play the game of guessing where this goes

- thiis is the current resolve_scale_mismatch, dont mess the already working things and only do the fixes. I dont want you to comment the fixes, but only what each block does.

-okk , i want two things to work so thats aliasing and the minimizing of scale, will those two things work? and it should be mapped exactly as well..

5. very high



Is this order correct for you? (y/n): n

Enter corrected scale (comma-separated, lowest → highest): low,average,high

⚠ You defined a scale for 'ground clearance', but no options have values for it.

[2] Ignore this criterion

Choice (default = 2): 1

Yeah well crap.. it doesnt let me map it it just goes to the next flow

Enter values for 'ground clearance':

Criteria summary (for ranking):

1. price (cost, unit: lakhs)


2. fuel efficiency (benefit, unit: kmpl)


3. maintenance cost (cost) → scale: very high < high < reasonable < low < very low


4. comfort (benefit) → scale: poor < okay < good < very good < excellent


5. driving feel (benefit) → scale: boring < predictable < decent < good < fun


6. safety (benefit) → scale: poor < average < safe < very safe < excellent


7. ground clearance (benefit) → scale: low < average < high
```
- Ill just go back to last commit
-  --pasted the whole o/p

- how was driving feel ignore? i mean its mapped right? Then why in the explanation payload was it excluded?

- just fix it

- --pasted debug again--

- Why isnt driving feel not taken into account, why is it missing? i mean its clearly being mapped
- jesus christ just tell me where all those changes should be done exactly there's like a gazikllion code in here

- well good news and bad news.. now the explanation builder is getting the data yaay.. bad news is..
- I need help deciding what vehicle to buy, and honestly my thoughts are all over the place.
- i used gemini cli to fix the inconsistancy in data but now...i mean look at it
- --pasted debug again--

- Im breaking things randomly omg

- Restore or re-add confirm_options
- i cant go back to the last commit dude.. because after fixing the crappy explanation builder i didnt commit ugh..
- i did add all the code above right, so just give me confirm_options

- nvm i looked at the changes and i copy pasted it from there
- yepp,its oficially over i tried many scenarios.. Sooo..yeah Its done couldn't find anything new
- --pasted debug-- it did ask me to rank work life balance, but it didnt let me.. like i didnt even press enter

- yeah well.. im done its working now..

- I want you to make a architecture diagram with the current files. Also make a simple png file and also a .drawio file so that I can actually make changes if it's wrong

- Next is the data flow diagram. I want you to make a dataflow diagam in the form of png as well as in draw.io format so that i can copy paste into the draw.io

- Yeah.. I dont understand shit just show the dataflow diagram here
- Let's go one by one , I'll draw in a book and lets see if I can make sense out of it.. the more detailed and simplified would be most better
- Where are the input helpers? Where are the ranking?

- --uploaded the drawn image--

- --uploaded the digram-- below is the input_helpers right?
```text
Input Helpers
↓
Attribute Mapper
↓
Decision Engine
↓
Explanation Builder
↓
Explanation Agent
```
- Yeah did all this
- Yeah  this is like primitive  there are no loops and shit
- Just give me the draw.io file With with the correct flow.. so I don't have to fuckn manually draw and waste my Time..make it Clean and human readable make sure there are arrows and markings in there

- Why IS DRAW.IO giving me a miniscule  Image
- WHY IN THE actual f IS THIS THING ZOOMING SOO  IN??
- I JUST WANT THE DIAGRAM AND THIS SHIT ISN'T LETTING ME
- nvm i got it
